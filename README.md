# TOXIC Editor

The Open XLIFF Internationalisation Content Editor.

## For whom is this project?

It is for those unfortunate people who are looking for a tool to work with XLIFF files but are neither
allowed to install one of the available programs on their (company-) computer and also may not
have access to paid online services.

### Supported formats

XLIFF 1.2 and 2.0

### Limitations

Not the full set of possibilities of the two formats is supported. The narrow focus is
to just make it through the day with what you usually need for translation files that
are part of an Angular application that uses the standard internationalisation.

## How does it work?

It works as a "single page application". All that you need to work with the translation file is loaded
right into your browser. The translation files used in the app will always stay on the local machine.

## Where can I find a working version?

A working version can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://silent-fred.github.io/toxic)

## What do I need to modify it or run it on my own server

It is a regular Angular application. Read the documentation at the
[Angular homepage](https://angular.io/) if you're unfamiliar with it.
The project has a rather liberal license. Grab the source code and do what
is necessary for your requirements.

Building, running a development server and all the other nitty-gritty is
the standard "out of the box" behaviour of Angular projects.
