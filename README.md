# TOXIC Editor

The open XLIFF internationalisation content editor.

## For whom is this project?

It is for those unlucky people who are looking for a tool to work with XLIFF files but are neither
allowed to install one of the available programs on their (company-) computer and also may not
have access to paid online services.

## How does it work?

It works as a "single page application". All that you need to work with the translation file is loaded
right into your browser. The translation files used in the app will always stay on the local machine.

## Where can I find a working version?

TODO Once I have set up a version either on the private web space or GitHub the link
will be added here.

## What do I need to modify it or run it on my own server

It is a regular Angular application. Read the documentation at the
[Angular homepage](https://angular.io/) if you're unfamiliar with it.
The project has a rather liberal license. Grab the source code and do what
is necessary for your requirements.

Building, running a development server and all the other nitty-gritty is
the standard "out of the box" behaviour of Angular projects.
